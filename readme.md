## HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - An Online Resource
Hello! I would like to thank you for stopping by! We are working on making an online resource that can be used by everyone, so they can get started **easily** without having to go out and buy a book! A larger description will come later.

#### Contributing
Thank you for considering contributing to our online resource! We currently are wanting people to help piece this online resource together, as one person just isn't enough! You can get started by writing some code and making a pull-request to the `dev` branch of this repo. A repo manager will then take a look, make suggestions, etc, and if it's good, it will be merged in!
